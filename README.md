# GPV's Utility Libraries Collection for C++
**version 1.0**

---
This is a collection of utility libraries for C++, based on the standard C++ library, with minimal external dependencies.
These libraries can come in handy for some small works (e.g. command line utilities) or used in other projects.

This collection include these libraries:
* **gpvulc_text** - Text buffering, processing and parsing (dependencies: none)
* **gpvulc_path** - File/directory path management (dependencies: none)
* **gpvulc_console** - Console utility (dependencies: none)

## Remarks
Even if designed with portability in mind, all libraries were developed with Visual Studio 2015 and tested on Windows platform (a porting to other platforms should be a nice contribution).
Some remarks about the `gpvulc` libraries:
* **gpvulc_text** is based on the standard C++ library, designed to provide a user-friendly programming interface, partly inspired by C# String class. This library should work with most operating systems.
* **gpvulc_path** is a file path management utility, it is something like `boost_filesystem` library; if you are already using [boost] you are encouraged to use `boost_filesystem`. This library should work with most operating systems.
* **gpvulc_console** is a console utility library.

The following naming convention is adopted for folders:
* `include`: header files
* `src`: source files
* `lib`: library files
* `bin`: executable files
* `projects`: solutions and projects
* `TEMP`: intermediate files generated by the building process

Projects for Visual Studio 2015 only are provided in this version.

**Note**: all these libraries use multi-byte character set, no Unicode support is currently implemented.

**Important:** these libraries must be linked as static libraries, they are not designed to be compiled and linked as dynamic linking libraries.
This feature could be a future development, changes are needed to prevent allocation and deallocation in different modules.

## Dependencies
Libraries dependencies are summarized here:
* **gpvulc_text**: none
* **gpvulc_path**: none
* **gpvulc_console**: none

For some libraries (e.g. `gpvulc_text` and `gpvulc_path`) test projects are provided, implemented using [Google C++ Testing Framework].

Libraries and their test projects are separated, so you can use the libraries without getting [Google C++ Testing Framework].

In the `depend` folder you must put a distribution of the external libraries used: [Google C++ Testing Framework]. Include files of [Google C++ Testing Framework] must be put in `depend/boost/` (e.g. `depend/boost/boost/`). Compiled binaries of [Google C++ Testing Framework] must be put in a proper subfolder of `depend/googletest/lib/` folder (e.g. `gtest.lib` and `gtestd.lib` in `depend/googletest/lib/VC140-x64/` and `depend/googletest/lib/VC140-x86/` for Visual Studio 2015 with 64 and 32 bit platforms).

You can change this configuration editing the property sheeets (`*.props` files) in `gpvulc-tests/` folder.

### Contributing

If you find bugs or you have any new idea for improvements and new features you can create an issue on GitHub (please follow the suggested template, filling the proper sections). To open issues or make pull requests please follow the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/gpvigano/gpvulc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

About multi-platform support: any contribution to support other platforms and compilers is welcome.

If you want to update the libraries you should build and run the tests in `gpvulc-tests/` folder with [Google C++ Testing Framework] before submitting your changes.
